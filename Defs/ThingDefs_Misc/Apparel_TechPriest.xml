		<label>Mechanicus robe</label>
		<description>A sturdy long robe, usually worn by the priesthood of the Adeptus Mechanicus. The individual design may vary, depending on the Forge World and the position of the priest in the Mechanicus hierarchy, as well as their body structure. These robes are adorned with Mechanicus iconography and gear-like ornaments signifying the wearer's position in the Mechanicus hierarchy.\n\nSuch robes have been a tradition since the earliest days of the Age of Strife, when Mars was isolated from Terra and Mars' atmospheric shields gave away, leaving the planet exposed to deadly radiation, so such thick sturdy robes and hoods became a necessity.</description>

		<label>Mechanicus hood</label>
		<description>A hood made out of sturdy material is the most common type of headgear for a member of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Usually it has the same color and ornament as the robe, however it's not required. Such hoods have been a tradition since the earliest days of the Age of Strife, when Mars was isolated from Terra and Mars' atmospheric shields gave away, leaving the planet exposed to deadly radiation, so such hoods and thick sturdy robes became a necessity.</description>
